Challenges For This Quest

Fix Cinemachine:
The project has been created using Cinemachine to make the camera follow the player. But its currently broken. Fix the camera by considering what you need to do with the Cinemachine package. Hint: we're using a Framing Transposer which follows the Hero.

Vanishing Enemy:
One of the enemies is disappearing without being captured. Figure out why and fix it so that this bug is not happening.

Stop The Party:
The celebration particles should last for 1 second then stop. But they keep looping. Use our bool variable to fix the celebration so that it doesn't keep playing.

Gotcha:
Its a bit boring when we capture an enemy. Create a new particle effect and trigger it to play when an enemy is captured.

Tricky Patterns:
Figure out how the enemies are moving and create more interesting (and varied) patterns for their dodging.

Counting Up:
Finish the Timer.cs script so that we display an ongoing timer in the top corner of the screen. For bonus points, show the timer with no decimal places, just whole numbers. Hints: explore the Time class in Unity docs and remember to convert your number to a string.

Restart The Action:
Restart the level after the player collects all the enemies and the celebration fireworks have finished. Make sure your timer resets when the level restarts. Hint: To create a delay we need to use Invoke or Coroutine.

Bullet Time:
When the Hero captures an enemy, briefly slow the game down for just a short amount of time (half a second or so). You know, bullet-time style. For bonus points, give the player some sort of indication that the game has briefly slowed down.

Spice It Up:
Complete your quest by make the game more interesting and visually appealing. See if you can add another game mechanic or something else about the game to make it interesting. Share your idea with us!
